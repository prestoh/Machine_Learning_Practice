# Repo for Machine Learning Practice
If the file is not listed below then it is incomplete:
  * (*)Audio_Analysis.ipynb (file takes up too much space, cannot test data without overloading RAM. Have to rethink preprocessing)
  * Clothing_Classifier_TensorFlow.ipynb
  * Fraud_Detection_Binary_Classification.ipynb
  * Transmission_Outage_Detection.ipynb
  
Models that don't preform well due to missing data:
  * Shoe_Price_Regression.ipynb
  * Video_Game_Sales_Regression.ipynb
