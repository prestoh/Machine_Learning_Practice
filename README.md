# Repo for Machine Learning Practice

* Modulation Classification: Two models built from different data (MATLAB data and RADIOML data set).
* Audio Classifier (incomplete)
* Fraud Detection using Binary Classification: Credit card fraud model
* Shoe Price Regression Model (model/data need improvements)
* Transmission Outage Classifier: CNN model to determine downed power lines
* Video Game Sales Regression Model (Need improvements to data/model)
